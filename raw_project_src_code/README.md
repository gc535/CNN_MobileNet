This is the source code we have so far for the c++ implementation. We have implemented up to the first depthwise convolution. We've started modularizing the functions for each layer. In order to execute the code, you need to compile main.cpp. We included the executable, a.out, inside the folder. The function takes in a pathway to a 224x224 .bmp file. It will perform everything up to the first depthwise convolution.

Example: ./a.out rsz_dog1.bmp
